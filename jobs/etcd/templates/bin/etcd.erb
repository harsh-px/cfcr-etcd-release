# we will bootstrap a single node cluster with the current node as the only member.

# When `spec.bootstrap` is true and there is an existing etcd member directory, we
# can assume that the cluster is already present, and start the etcd node normally.

# When `spec.bootstrap` is false and there is no existing etcd member directory,
